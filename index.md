title: FAIR Research Data - Best Practice and Tools

> [**There is no point in wasting good thoughts on bad data.**](https://wellcome.ac.uk/news/sir-john-sulston-and-human-genome-project)


Do you want your research to contribute to knowledge?  
Do you want your work to be useful by others?  
Do you want your work today to be understood by yourself a year from now?

If your answer to any of these questions is yes,
then you should want to organize your work so that its products are
**Findable**, **Accessible**, **Interoperable**, and **Reusable**: in other words, **FAIR**.
