Do you want your research to contribute to knowledge?  
Do you want your work to be useful by others?  
Do you want your work today to be understood by yourself a year from now?

If your answer to any of these questions is yes,
then you should want to organize your work so that its products are
**Findable**, **Accessible**, **Interoperable**, and **Reusable**: in other words, **FAIR**.
