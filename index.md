title: FAIR Research Data - Best Practice and Tools

> [**There is no point in wasting good thoughts on bad data.**](https://wellcome.ac.uk/news/sir-john-sulston-and-human-genome-project)


Do you want your research to contribute to knowledge?  
Do you want your work to be useful by others?  
Do you want your work today to be understood by yourself a year from now?

If your answer to any of these questions is **yes**,
then you should want to organize your work so that its products are
Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable: in other words, **FAIR**.

This site is intended to provide access to resources relevant to FAIR research.
To start with, we provide tools for working with:

* [Big Data Bags (**BDBags**)](https://github.com/fair-research/bdbag): An exchange format for exchanging large and complex data collections.
* [Minimum viable identifiers (**Minids**)](https://github.com/fair-research/minid): Lightweight identifiers that can be easily created, resolved, and used.
