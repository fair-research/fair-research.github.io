Do you want your research to contribute to knowledge?
Do you want your work to be useful by others?
Do you want your work today to be understood by yourself a year from now?

<p>

If your answer to any of these questions is <b>yes</b>,
then you should want to organize your work so that its products are
<b>F</b>indable, <b>A</b>ccessible, <b>I</b>nteroperable, and <b>R</b>eusable: that is, so that they are <b>FAIR</b>.

<p>

This site is intended to provide access to resources relevant to FAIR research.
To start with, we provide tools for:

<ul>
<li> Big Data Bags (<b>BDBags</b>): An exchange format and associated tools for exchanging large and complex data collections.</li>
<li> Minimum viable identifiers (<b>Minids</b>): Lightweight identifiers that can be easily created, resolved, and used.</li>
</ul>
