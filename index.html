Do you want your research to contribute to knowledge?
Do you want your work to be understood by others?
Or maybe you just want your work today to be understood by yourself a year from now?

<p>

If your answer to any of these questions is <b>yes</b>,
then you should want to organize your work so that its products are
<b>F</b>indable, <b>A</b>ccessible, <b>I</b>nteroperable, and <b>R</b>eusable: that is, so that they are <b>FAIR</b>.

<p>

This site is intended to provide access to resources relevant to FAIR research.
To start with, we provide tools for:

<ul>
<li> Big Data Bags (<b>BDBags</b>): An exchange format and associated tools for exchanging large and complex data collections.</li>
<li> Minimum viable identifiers (<b>Minids</b>): Lightweight identifiers that can be easily created, resolved, and used.</li>
</ul>
